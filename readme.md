Charba - GWT wrapper for CHART.JS
===============================================

Version 1.2

What's Charba
--------

[Google Web toolkit](http://www.gwtproject.org/) doesn't have charting library available out of the box.

There are some open source charting libraries for GWT available to be used but with some constraints or unclear items:

 * internet connection needed
 * open source license not completely clear, sometimes with some obligations like to add specific labels
 * old packages not longer maintained

For all these reasons, **Charba** has been developed, leveraging on [Chart.JS](http://www.chartjs.org/) capabilities which are now available to GWT developers.
    
Building
--------

To build **Charba**, you can check out the project and to run [Ant build.xml](https://github.com/pepstock-org/Charba/blob/master/build.xml).

It creates a `charba.[version.release].jar` file into `dist` folder, ready to be included into your project.
